As a passionate and experienced software developer with over 4 years of experience, I have honed my skills in Java and have gained a strong understanding of JavaScript and React When I was a little kid, I loved putting my toys together to create imaginary robots. I would take them apart and then try to fix them, often saying, "Mom, why don't these toys have strings?" As time passed and I grew up, I started building and coding little robots on my own. My little hobby turned into a YouTube channel, teaching Software tutorials and getting sponsorships. During this period I also developed my design skills - being a content creator was no easy task!

Of course, time never stopped. Just before high school, I was mentored by a software developer I knew and I started coding for real. When I started high school, I participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition, which gave me the opportunity to build robots taller than me. As I got older, robotics became more of a hobby for me.

Now, I am 17 years old and I spend my days constantly improving myself with dreams of starting my own company in the future. Besides my passion for technology and design, I love listening to music, playing guitar and I am also a soloist.
